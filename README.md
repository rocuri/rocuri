# HELLO WORLD!

Hey, I am just a guy from the interior of the northern region of Brazil who loves programming, science, and technology. I am Bachelor in computer science, software developer at [Lambda3](https://lambda3.com.br) and a Master's degree student in computer science researching optimization algorithms in logistics and routing as a member of the [LAAI](http://laai.ufpa.br) (_Laboratory of Applied Artificial Intelligence_) at Federal University of Par√°.

I have a technical profile. I'm a C/C++ programmer, Linux and open-source software enthusiastic and, I have interests in mid-level languages such as Rust and GoLang.

As both a developer and a scientist, I believe in the power of the community to build better and safer things,
sharing knowledge is the best way to improve it.
